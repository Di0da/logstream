# LogStream

A visually pleasing way to show log entries in real time.

## Demo

* [Click here to see a demo](http://www.olejon.net/code/logstream/app/?stream=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.olejon.net%2Fcode%2Flogstream%2Fstream%2F&interval=6&timer=true)

The demo checks a JSON file for changes every six seconds. The data is random. In a real life scenario there won't necessarily be new data every six seconds. The animation is only shown when there's new data.
